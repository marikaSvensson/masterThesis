\emph{In this report  two types of antennas were simulated in MATLAB. Initially  a horizontal dipole antenna was investigated by computing the far field function, the radiated power and lastly the far field patterns in the E- and H-plane. }\\

\emph{Then an irregularly spaced array antenna was investigated. First the far field was computed as a function of antenna positions and excitation current. Then the  excitation current was computed as a function of scanning angles and array element positions. Lastly an equispaced array antenna was considered. The radiation pattern were computed for the H plane and broadside with different intermediate spacing d. }

%\emph{The result of from the simulations corresponded well/badly with expected theoretical results.}
